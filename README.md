MORE INFO

The model learns to classify handwritten digits using multi class classification (also known as one vs all).
After getting the best hypothesis and parameters for the numbers 0-9, the user can draw their own digits to see
if the model correctly predicts it. The parameters are also saved for later use.

The model is based off of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.
